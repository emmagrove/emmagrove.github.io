00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.837
Hey, Covey.

2
00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:05.464
Hello from Korea.

3
00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:10.260
The best part of this vacation
is spending time with my sisters.

4
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.889
But pretty soon we’ll be back
from spring break,

5
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.266
then I’ll tackle you
and smother you with kisses

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.392
and give you gifts.

7
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:18.727
I miss you.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.312
I can’t wait to see you.

9
00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.815
It’s hard to believe…

10
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.238
what all started with a letter,

11
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.366
a hot tub, and a diner,

12
00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.284
could turn into this.

13
00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.454
Lara Jean Song Covey…

14
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.749
will you go to prom with me?

15
00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.085
Yes, of course.

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.056
On a scale from one to ten, how much will you
miss me when I’m gone next year?

17
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.391
-Four.
-A four?

18
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.978
I’m glad you and Peter
are both going to Stanford.

19
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.479
You're not cut out
for long distance.

20
00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.855
I haven’t gotten in yet.

21
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.984
-Make sure that’s what you want.
-It’s what I want, and it’s perfect.

22
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.319
You gotta go.

23
00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.364
Know what I’m looking forward to
the most about college?

24
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.825
Never having to say goodnight.

25
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.787
Goodnight.

26
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.705
Yeah.

27
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.713
Next stop on the senior trip,
New York City!

28
00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.382
Heather is taking me
to a cool party tonight.

29
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.555
I could really see myself
living there, you know?

30
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.766
We both know
what 3,000 miles would do to us.

31
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.436
This is a little dramatic,
even for you.

32
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.776
Will I look back in 20 years and
wonder if I made the wrong choice?

33
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.157
Can you guys turn around?
This is so embarrassing.

34
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.199
Not a chance, Chrissy.

35
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.545
You can’t save this relationship
by not growing.

36
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.591
The world keeps shifting
under my feet.

37
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.470
All I want is for it to stand still.

38
00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.017
I didn’t get in.
